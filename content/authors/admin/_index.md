## About Me

Welcome to visit my website!

I am currently a researcher in Advanced Functional Polymers Center (advisor: Dr. Yun Ho Kim) at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). Before I joined KRICT, I received a master degree in chemical engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) (advisor: Prof. Dong Woog Lee).

My primary interest lies in the design of materials based on interface science for practical applications. I directly measure interaction forces across various scales and conditions, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced materials. My research encompasses not only the synthesis of multi-functional polymers for adhesives and batteries but also the development of nanoparticle hybridization. Nowadays, I continue to study interfacial science and strive to apply it to medical device technology.
